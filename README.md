# Credit Card Fraud Detection using AutoEncoder

Developed and implemented an AutoEncoder model using Keras to identify fraudulent transactions in a highly unbalanced credit card dataset sourced from Kaggle.
Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to visualize the imbalance between normal and fraudulent transactions and examine summary statistics of transaction data.
Engineered features and prepared data by normalizing transaction amounts and segregating dataset into training and testing sets to optimize model training.
Utilized advanced visualization techniques to explore transaction amount data and detect patterns typical to fraudulent activities.
Implemented a method to calculate reconstruction error for model validation, establishing a threshold to differentiate between normal and fraudulent transactions effectively.
Evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix on the testing set, achieving a detection rate of approximately 60% for fraudulent transactions while maintaining a manageable false positive rate.
Discussed the real-world application and challenges of deploying fraud detection systems, including regulatory, privacy concerns, and the necessity of integrating multiple detection systems.
Shared insights on the role of data science in enhancing organizational fraud detection capabilities, emphasizing collaborative efforts within team environments.
